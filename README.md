Aardvark is a library for creating cross platform applications for desktop and
mobile devices using JavaScript and React.

Aardvark includes own GUI rendering engine written in C++ that uses Skia library
for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics.
It does not use system controls or web view, everything is rendered from scratch.
Such approach makes possible to get exactly expected result on all platforms.

Goal of this project is to allow developers to control by themselves how their
applications should work, and not depend on the features and limitations of
different platforms.

Currently it is under development and not ready for use.
